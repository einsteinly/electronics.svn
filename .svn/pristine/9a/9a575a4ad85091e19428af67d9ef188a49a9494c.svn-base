Written a long while after so may not be 100% accurate:

These was a battery monitoring board that went between the 12V battery and the floating router.

Functions:
	- Cut off power to the router if battery voltage gets too low
	- Have hysteresis in the cut-off
	- Display a rough state of charge on an LED array

Problems:
	- Array was a multicoloured segment display (some green, some yellow, some red) but this was not properly communicated to the original designer so it is wired in reverse (red = good, green = bad)

Notes:
	- Built on veroboard only
	- Used high-voltage logic chips (which could handle up to 15V if I remember correctly)
