QUOTATION INFORMATION
---------------------
* Circuit Size(mm): 120x110mm (bounding box)
* Copper weight: 1oz
* Material: 1.6mm FR4
* Number of holes: 461
* Smallest hole: 0.3mm
* Largest hole: 3mm
* Min track width space: 0.15mm (for USB tracks, most of the board should be 0.2-0.3 min)
* Solder resist - blue if possible, otherwise whatever is easiest (green)
* Silkscreen - top & bottom - white
* Surface Finish - Gold (preferably, otherwise whatever is easiest / most reasonable)

BOARD INFORMATION
-----------------
* 4-layer
* Dimensions: 120x110mm
* Outline defined on top silkscreen layer (please crop the connector silkscreen which extends past the board outline)
* Solder resist - blue if possible, otherwise whatever is easiest (green)
* Silkscreen - top & bottom - white

LAYER STACK
-----------
mcb.gto - top silkscreen
mcb.gts - top solder mask
mcb.gtl - top copper layer
mcb.gp1 - internal plane 1
mcb.gp2 - internal plane 2
mcb.gbl - bottom copper layer
mcb.gbs - bottom solder mask
mcb.gbo - bottom silkscreen
mcb.txt - NC drill file

NOTES: the silkscreen layers a very complicated, due to the presence of logos and other graphics. The bottom silkscreen contains an EXTREMELY large logo, which in some places extends past the board edge. Would it be possible to have the silkscreen 'cropped' to the board edge. If the bottom silkscreen is unexceptable, please mention it, and I will generate a version without the large logo.

GERBER OUTPUT SETTINGS
----------------------
* Units: inches
* Format: 2:5
* reference to absolute origin
* keep leading and trailing zeroes

NOTE: A higher-than-normal gerber resolution has been used so that the bottom silkscreen remains accurate / as-wanted.

If there's any issues with any of the above information or the gerber files, I'm happy to adjust them to make them acceptable.
