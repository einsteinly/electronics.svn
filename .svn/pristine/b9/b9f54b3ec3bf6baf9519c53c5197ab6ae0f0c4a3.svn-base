* Double check hirose connector pinout --DONE

* Spec any remaining components and generate a BOM

* Split the BATT- and BATT+ nets from V-1 and V+5? So the DRC checker doesn't complain that we haven't connected them together (as indeed we shouldn't according to the design guide)

* check Fuse Holder footprint


* check hirose connector alignment between boards -- DONE
