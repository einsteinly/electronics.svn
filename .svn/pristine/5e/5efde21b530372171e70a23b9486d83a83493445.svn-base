NOTES: The design of this board is much more exotic than designs commonly submitted by us. if any part of the design exceeds reasonable manufacturing specifications please say, so we can attempt to modify the design appropriately.
This board would ideally like to be made from 2oz copper, but I believe this would cause the design to exceed the specifications possible.
