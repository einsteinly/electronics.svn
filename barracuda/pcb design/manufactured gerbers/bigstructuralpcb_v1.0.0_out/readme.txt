NOTES: The design of this board is extremely large (440mm in one dimension). However, due it its slenderness, panelisation should be possible. The bms_struct_v1.0.0 PCB also submitted has identical layer stackup and requirements, so could also be panelised on the same board.

GERBER OUTPUT SETTINGS
