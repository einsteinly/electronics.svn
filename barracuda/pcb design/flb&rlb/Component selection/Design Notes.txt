Bridgelux BXRA-N0402 chosen as it is neutral white, and can be fitted to a small reflector
Reflector is:

Due to the large range of input voltages to be designed for, the current range is limited by a desire for reasonable ripple currents, so PWM control is recommended.

It was decided to use the LM3409 chip for the Strobes and power them individually. connecting them in series and powering them over the 12V-21V range is difficult and connecting them in parallel can easily lead to big differences in brightness. The LM3409 also has great design guide, has a small package and operating purely in BUCK mode had greater efficiencies associated with it.
